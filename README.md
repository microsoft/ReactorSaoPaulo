# Microsoft Reactor Workshops

**Update:** Due to the concerns surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, we have temporarily suspended programming and events in all Reactor locations as the health and safety of our community and employees is our top priority. We are now offering online learning opportunities for our current content. For more information about online events refer to:
- [Reactor website](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/)
- [Reactor Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/pro/microsoft-reactor)
- [Reactor Twitter](https://twitter.com/msftreactor)

Welcome to Microsoft's Reactor Workshop Content Repository!

In this repo you will find various resources for workshops that Microsoft runs around the world in each of the Reactor locations. If you find any errors or have ideas for improvements, we welcome you to contribute to this repo by opening a PR.

## Existing Content

We currently have several workshops that we run at each of our Reactor locations around the world. 

| Workshop | Description | Learning Resource | Slides |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Introduction to Python for Data Science | "Data enables us to understand the world around us. Whether we're gathering data about our natural world to understand how it is changing, or analyzing patterns in how societies grow and change to ensure we're supporting all people, data is what drives the conversation. In this one-day workshop, we invite you to take the first step to learning how to understand data. With the power of Python, you will be able to explore data more quickly and develop more complex learnings from that data with just a few lines of code. Step 1: Learn the basics of Python coding and understand how it can be used to digest large data sets. | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/DataScience1](https://aka.ms/DataScience1) | [Data Science 1 Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Data_Science_1_Slides.pptx) |
| Beginners Data Science for Python Developers | Every day new data is created. New parts are made and shipped from factories, people continuously tweet, and companies grow and fluctuate causing major changes in the market. With the addition of more data comes the difficulty of being able to process that data. As humans, we can understand complex scenarios, but computers are much better at being able to analyze large datasets. In this workshop, you will get a glimpse into how we can teach machines to analyze complex scenarios at a much larger scale than we're able to. After you've cleaned and organized your data, you will have an opportunity to train and test machine learning models, and even publish your predictor online for others to explore. | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/DataScience2](https://aka.ms/DataScience2) | [Data Science 2 Full Day Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Data_Science_2_Slides.pptx) [Data Science 2 Half Day Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Data_Science_2_Slides_3_Hour.pptx) |
| Making Your Data Useful for Analysis | Having complete and accurate data is a critical first step to being able to learn from it, but part of the complexity of data science is narrowing down what part of the data is important. In this introductory workshop to Machine Learning you will begin to understand how to narrow down the feature scope of your data so that the predictions are based on causation and not just correlation. | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/ReactorML1](https://aka.ms/ReactorML1) | [Machine Learning 1 Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Machine-Learning-1-Dec-2019.pptx) |
| Using Advanced Machine Learning Models | What happens when you encounter large data sets that are more nuanced than a set of concrete numbers? When you begin to explore natural language, or data sets with many potential influential features, you require more complex and predictive machine learning models. In this advanced Data Science workshop, learn about K-Means, Naive Bayes, and Regression models that will better support complex data and questions.  | [Learning Materials found at: aka.ms/ReactorML2](https://aka.ms/ReactorML2) | [Machine Learning 2 Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/Machine-Learning-2-Dec-2019.pptx) |
| Building Software That Recognizes You | Are you a developer who is curious how your computer or phone recognize it's you and not your sibling when you try to unlock the device? With the power of Azure artificial intelligence (Cognitive Services) and your existing coding powers, we invite you to join us on a Python+Flask+Azure journey to build your very own smart app! | [Learning Materials found at: AI_1](AI_1/) | [AI Workshop Slides](https://reactorworkshops.blob.core.windows.net/workshopslides/AI_Workshop_Slides.pptx) |
| Getting started with HTML & CSS – Page layout and design | If you’re interested in exploring creating websites, the most logical first step is learning the core components used to display information in a browser. In this 6 hour workshop you will start by getting hands on experience with HTML, and see how to use tags to identify certain sections of a page, and allow the user to enter information. You’ll then play with CSS, which will allow you to format the page’s content and determine where everything goes. Upon completion you’ll have a great foundation on which to continue your journey towards becoming a web developer. | [Learning Materials found at: Web Fundamentals 1](Web_Fundamentals_1/) | [Web Fundamentals 1 Slides](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors/blob/master/Web_Fundamentals_1/Instructor_Materials/Web_Dev_Fun_1.pptx) |
| Getting Started with JavaScript – Making Pages Dynamic | If you want to start programming for the web, one language you’ll need to have in your toolbelt is JavaScript. JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web. With the use of JavaScript you can make your pages dynamic and interactive. In this 6 hour workshop you’ll see how to get started with JavaScript, walk through the core syntax and functionality. You’ll also gain experience with libraries and frameworks which can help make your life as a developer easier. Upon completion you’ll have a great foundation in the most popular programming language in the world. | [Learning Materials found at: Web Fundamentals 2](Web_Fundamentals_2/) | [Web Fundamentals 2 Slides](https://github.com/microsoft/Reactors/blob/master/Web_Fundamentals_2/Instructor_Materials/Web_Dev_Fun_2.pptx) |
